The configuration service is a vital component of any microservices architecture. Based on the twelve-factor app methodology, configurations for your microservice applications should be stored in the environment and not in the project.

Configuration is hosted in this repository: https://github.com/ivans-innovation-lab/my-company-configuration-repository

## Running instructions

```bash
$ cd my-company-configuration-backingservice
$ ./mvnw spring-boot:run
```
